## Figures


### Figure 1 - Antenna Selection Procedure

Illustration of antenna selection method for different number of antennas. 
The dark dots are the selected antennas, while the 6 penthagon markers indicate the centre of the 6 clusters. 
The non-selected antenna positions are plotted with transparancy.
